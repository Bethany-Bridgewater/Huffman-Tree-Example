The user selects between 1 and 6 to interact with the program. The program has a tree already made (“default message.”) or the user can create a new huffman tree with their own message. There are options to display the message, display the coded message, display the tree, and display the code table. If a user enters something other than an int, the program will crash here. If you enter a number other than 1-6 you will be prompted again.

The program can accept a message with any character in the extended ASCII set, and will accept a message that is multiple lines. The program can output a tree, but some anomalies occur with larger trees. The displayTree method is taken from the book (Data Structures and Algorithms in Java by Lafore).
